## GIPEDI Weekly Meet 7
#### June 25, 2021
Prof Subrat Kar explained the importance of communication, body language and facial expression during communication. He added that it is useful to know how to interact casually with strangers without giving/asking any personal information. It is helpful for personal development.

## GIPEDI One-to-one Interaction with Prof Samaresh Das
#### June 29, 2021
Prof Das went through the updated presentation file that I had shared with him, containing the simulation outputs. He said that the simulation outputs were satisfactory and suggested me to write an abstract about the simulations. He shared me the contact detail of one of his PhD Scholars, Mr. Suprovat Gosh, to seek guidance from him for the same.

## Metamaterial Project Progress
By varying some geometric parameters of the design, I observed the following:

#### 1. Increasing the thickness of substrate:

#### 2. Decreasing the diameter of the vias under substrate:

#### 3. Increasing the thickness of the concentric square ring slots on the top-layer:

### Inference:
From the above observations, the following has been infered:
   1. As the thickness of the substrate increases, absorptivity decreases.
   2. As the thickness of the vias decreases, number of absorption bands increases.
   3. As the thickness of the slots increases, absorptivity increases. 

### Plan for next week
- Use spiral resonator in place of concentric ring resonator to get broader absorption band since the former offers higher electrical length [1].
- Read materials on metasurface
- Write an abstract about the simulations
  
### Growth of my Coriander plant

 More Coriander leaves have started to grow.
